			<h2>The Fang Law Firm: Who We Are.</h2>

			<p>Our team of personal injury lawyers have worked in large law firms where we were required to handle hundreds of injury cases. While we were able to help many of our clients achieve justice, it was clear that it is impossible for a single attorney, even with exceptional legal talents, to provide each client with the attention and focus they deserved.</p>

			<p>We then established a law firm built around providing a far superior client experience. At The Fang Law Firm, we take on a limited number of cases, allowing our personal injury lawyers to provide ongoing, personalized legal service. We are not your average, everyday personal injury law firm, or one of the large, impersonal law firms you see advertised on TV. We are a team of experienced litigators who provide dedicated personal attention to the people we represent. Why should you call The Fang Law Firm for help?</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Our legal team has over a decade of experience in personal injury law and has   
     litigated more than 10,000 combined cases.</li>
		 <li>We get proven results with a 98% success rate.</li>
		 <li> We do not employ legal assistants or paralegals to handle our clients. Our 
     cases are handled directly by our attorneys who will give you undivided  
     attention.</li>
		 <li>We maintain a direct, open line of communication with our clients, available 
     for any questions or concerns at any time of the day. We have a phone call      
     guarantee policy: we promise to return your call within 24 hours.</li>
		 <li> We operate on a contingency fee basis â€“ you do not pay any legal fees until we 
     reach a settlement or win your case.</li>
		</ul>
