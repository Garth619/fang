			<h2>Why Choose The Fang Law Firm in Denver?</h2>
		
			<p>At the Fang Law Firm, we are driven by a single guiding principle: Our injured clients deserve personal representation and communication at every step of a personal injury case. We believe in hands-on case management – your injury case will not be turned over to a case manager or paralegal who has little to no legal knowledge or experience, but will be handled personally by our lawyers, from start to finish.</p> 

			<h3>Why You Need a Lawyer</h3>
 
			<p>In a perfect world, after suffering a serious injury, the victim would be treated with honesty, compassion, and fairness. When an injury case involves serious or life-changing injuries, insurance companies typically engage in various legal strategies in the attempt to deny or reduce the value of a settlement. Without the assistance of an attorney who has extensive experience in personal injury law, both in negotiating settlements and achieving justice in court, you and your case are at risk.</p>

			<p>At the Fang Law Firm, our attorneys are experienced, professional, and personally dedicated to pursuing full compensation for the people we represent. The Colorado statute of limitations restricts the time in which you have the right to file a personal injury lawsuit, and we urge you to contact us as soon as possible after a serious injury accident.</p>

			<p>Insurance companies are not concerned with protecting your right and interests – the goal is to pay out as little as can be negotiated. Sadly, many seriously injured persons are end up having claims denied the financial value greatly diminished. While an insurance company representative may be friendly when speaking to you, he or she is often busy employing a specific set of tactics designed to make it possible to limit the value of your claim. At The Fang Law Firm, we will not allow you to fall victim to such strategies and will zealously protect your rights and interests. </p>
